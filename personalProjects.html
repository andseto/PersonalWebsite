                        Computer Tetris Game
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        This Tetris game is coded in C# and it had a lot of elements of programming. There was use of 2D
                        arrays and matrix use as well as Object-Oriented Programming. It also introduced me into
                        importing images within code and setting pre-set images for block rotations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More details about the game are every function is working including rotation, clearing, points,
                        store/place, and much more. When the block comes down and places it changed the large 2D array
                        from 0's to 1's and will be on a loop to clear or not clear if the row is all 1's.

                        CheckList Using Database
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        The CheckList program that I made in C# was my taste into databases. Learning how to connect to
                        the SQL database was very interesting especially learning how to write and read data from it.
                        Elements like C# front end design and backend connection were used.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore the database was originally locally ran but I wanted it to be a working program
                        24/7. To achieve this I found a temporary free SQL Database service online to store on. Now with
                        the SQL Database not being limited by my computer on-time, the checklist could run while I was
                        away. At the moment the checklist program is down because the SQL service is no longer free.

                        Virtual Painter
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Virtual Painter is a C++ program that uses a marker(s) that the camera looks for and draws the
                        corresponding color. Use of code to enable the camera and an understanding how different colors
                        have their own black and white color codes make this project possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This program uses the idea that each color has different characteristics for blacks and whites.
                        For example, blue might need more black to become fully black. While red might need less black.
                        This can all be recorded by color code within the program. When the color code is matched in the
                        camera, it will draw circles of the corresponding color.

                    <p>
                        The StarBucks Website Copy is an HTML and CSS mini-project all about front end development.
                        Getting a taste of HTML and Website development by copying their website and coding it myself.
                        This was starter project to develop my skills and understanding of HTML and CSS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HTML and CSS is something I wanted to get into more as it was a different style of coding. My
                        background of mainly some backend coding is very interesting but I wanted to further my coding
                        knowledge and experience.

                    <p>
                        TalkingPoint is another HTML CSS website that only has some front-end website features. It is
                        my second mini-project for HTML and learning more about elements within HTML. Features like
                        LandingPage, Login, Register, and more were fontend developed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project might turn into a larger project but for now I have only developed the visual
                        HTML and CSS functions. Backend programming like databases and more still needs to be
                        implimented at a later time.
