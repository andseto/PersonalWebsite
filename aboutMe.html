                    I was born in Connecticut but moved to Arizona at a young age, where I developed a love for creating
                    and building. Whether it was constructing wooden projects, repurposing bike parts, or building with
                    Legos, I was always driven by creativity and a desire to bring ideas to life. When I got my first
                    computer, this passion shifted to digital design through AutoDesk Inventor and even Minecraft.
                    Today, I channel that same drive for innovation into programming and software development, building
                    impactful solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently a Junior at Arizona State University, pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Software
                    Engineering, with an expected graduation date of May 2026. My time at ASU has equipped me with
                    valuable skills, including communication, teamwork, and the discipline to meet deadlines and
                    expectations. Applying these skills to my day-to-day life is second nature to me now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a more fun note, here are some facts about me: I learned how to safely and properly handle
                    firearms at the age of 5, and I have a younger brother who’s a freshman at ASU studying business
                    marketing. In my free time, I also enjoy playing sports and video games with friends to stay active
                    and connected. I’m also passionate about finance, exploring topics like taxes, budgeting, and the
                    stock market.
