                        General Dynamics is a government contractor specializing in solutions for air, space,
                        land, and water. As a Software Engineer Intern, I have been working with the Rescue 21 program,
                        which collaborates with the U.S. Coast Guard to locate and assist sunken vessels in distress.

                    <p>
                        I joined General Dynamics in March 2024 and have contributed to a variety of projects. My work
                        has included developing and enhancing internal tools for the software team, streamlining
                        processes, and integrating software like Git to improve workflows. Notably, I programmed a
                        script to automatically sort data from distressed vessels, generate and format new files, and
                        securely store the information. Currently, I am working on updating the communication software
                        among the vessels, U.S. Coast Guard, and General Dynamics, ensuring more efficient and
                        reliable communication during emergency situations.

                        Salt River Project is one of Arizona's largest utility companies, providing electricity and
                        water to a significant portion of the state. Its primary focus is managing the region's water
                        supply and delivering reliable, affordable electricity to residential, commercial, and
                        industrial customers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I joined Salt River Project in July 2023 as an Architecture and Planning Intern, where I
                        collaborate with Enterprise Architects and various organizations within SRP to drive operational
                        efficiency and cost savings. My role has involved facilitating data processes and contributing
                        to cross-functional projects that enhance the company's performance. I have strengthened my
                        expertise in tools like SQL, ServiceNow, Power BI Desktop, and Microsoft Excel. Notably, I
                        worked on streamlining data workflows and visualizations, ensuring seamless integration of
                        information across departments to support decision-making and strategic planning.
